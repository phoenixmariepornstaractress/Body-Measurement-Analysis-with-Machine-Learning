# Body Measurement Analysis with Machine Learning

This project uses body measurement data to classify body types using various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualization.

## Features

* Feature extraction using domain-specific logic
* Multiple classification algorithms
* Feature importance and PCA visualizations
* Permutation importance analysis
* Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
